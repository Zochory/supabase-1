If you want to understand how it works under the hood, you can read this   section .  All you need to do is to create a   login.vue  and   confirm.vue  page in the   pages  folder.   For advanced users who want to implement the auth behaviour themselves, you can disable or override the   redirect options .  Log-in page -   /login  Each time a user is trying to access a page that needs authentication, he will automatically be redirected to the configured log in page. If you want to allow access to \"public\" page, you just need to add them in the   exclude  redirect option.   Ensure to activate the authentication providers you want in the Supabase Dashboard under   Authentication -> Providers .  The log-in page initiates the log-in method(s) you choose from the   available authorization methods  provided by Supabase, it could looks like:      \u003C  script     setup     lang  =  \"ts\"  >\n   const     supabase     =     useSupabaseClient  ()\n   const     email     =     ref  (  ''  )\n   \n   const     signInWithOtp     =     async   ()   =>   {\n       const   {   error   }   =     await   supabase.auth.  signInWithOtp  ({\n       email: email.value,\n       options: {\n         emailRedirectTo:   'http://localhost:3000/confirm'  ,\n       }\n     })\n       if   (error) console.  log  (error)\n   }\n   \u003C/  script  >\n   \u003C  template  >\n     \u003C  div  >\n       \u003C  button     @click  =  \"signInWithOtp\"  >\n         Sign In with E-Mail\n       \u003C/  button  >\n       \u003C  input\n           v-model  =  \"email\"\n           type  =  \"email\"\n       />\n     \u003C/  div  >\n   \u003C/  template  >  Once the authorization flow is triggered using the   auth  wrapper of the   useSupabaseClient  composable, the session management is handled automatically and the user will be redirected to the page you specify in the redirect option (  /confirm  by default).  Confirm page -   /confirm  The confirmation page receives the supabase callback. From there you can watch on the user value and redirect to the appropriate page.
